Terra-Tales 
-----
A game set in the near future where it has become an uninhabitable wasteland. Resources in this world are lacking due to these harsh conditions. Our protagonist realises the damage that has been inflicted and wishes to rectify the past. So he travels back in time and ventures through different zones in order to save the planet before disaster strikes again. He learns about their previous mistakes and solves them by finding solutions to the problems that have affected the development of climate
change, while also overcoming obstacles along the way. When the final challenge is completed he will be brought back to the present where all issues have been fixed and his lands are prospering.

Are you ready for the challenge?
